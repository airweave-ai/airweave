This document serves as a reference doc for Tonik during the design sprint.

The general idea is to capture Airweave's brand story, product positioning, target audience, goals for the website, and practical requirements (analytics, tracking, user journey). Aim is get into the design sprint with a clear shared vision and concrete inputs that Tonik can build from.

# ‚ñ∏ Product & Brand

[Image: image.png]

**Core story and vision**

Airweave is a developer tool that gives AI agents the ability to retrieve timely, relevant, accurate, and actionable information from human-facing applications and databases. We provide the connective tissue that turns scattered private data into accessible agent knowledge.

Airweave **does not** build agents, **does not** do web search, and **is not** an API integration framework (like Composio, Klavis, or Pipedream).

**Mission and positioning**

We solve the problem of agent builders needing advanced, reliable search across many applications. Instead of spending weeks building fragile integrations, developers can add powerful search capabilities to their agents in just a few lines of code.

**Values and personality traits**

Serious, reliable, trustworthy, transparent, stable, developer-first, truth-seeking, quietly confident.

**Differentiation**

  - API designed specifically for use by agents, not humans

  - Focus on search across human-facing applications and databases

  - Simple developer experience, only a few lines of code required

**Tagline candidates (OLD!)**

  - *Build smarter agents*

  - *Empower agents with deep knowledge of your apps and workspaces*

**ELI5 explanation (for design metaphors/visuals)**

Airweave is like giving your AI agent a search bar into all your apps and databases, so it can instantly find the right information without the agent builder having to manually wire everything together.

---

# ‚ñ∏ Audience & Use Case of Website

**Primary users**

  - Independent developers and hands-on engineers ("I just want to get my agent working")

  - Engineering managers or CTOs evaluating tooling

  - Startup founders building AI-native products

**Secondary audiences**

  - Investors (credibility and traction signals)

  - Potential hires (attracted by brand and vision)

  - Open source users (future contributors and community members)

**Customer journey for primary users**

A developer building agents encounters the '*search problem'* and lands on Airweave's site.

Roughly, this is the journey we want them to take:

  1. **Recognition of value**

    - Instantly see that Airweave solves their problem (agents need reliable access to app and database knowledge).

    - Trust that adoption requires minimal effort.

  1. **Exploration**

    - Learn how to implement Airweave with simple examples and clear explanations.

    - Quickly find pricing, packages, and technical documentation.

  1. **Action**

    - Create an Airweave account, or

    - Clone the repo and start building, or

    - Book a meeting with the team.

  1. **Conversion and retention**

    - Move from trial or open source use into a paid account.

    - Become part of the community (contributing, sharing, or scaling use).

**Tone for this audience**

Direct, developer-first, minimal friction e.g. "just ship the agent."

---

# ‚ñ∏ Goals of Website

**Primary goals**

  - Convert individual developers, startup founders, and scale-ups into active users (signups, paid accounts).

  - Generate enterprise leads through demo requests or meetings.

**Secondary goals**

  - Drive account signups at **app.airweave.ai**.

  - Increase GitHub stars and repo engagement.

  - Grow our open source community.

**Tertiary goals**

  - Establish credibility and brand trust.

  - Support potential future hiring by making Airweave attractive to talent.

  - Signal momentum to (prospective) investors and partners.

  - Position Airweave as a thought leader in the AI infra space.

**Key calls to action (CTAs)**

  - **Sign up and start using now** (fastest path to value).

  - **Book a call / talk to us** (enterprise lead gen).

  - **Clone the repo** (open source adoption).

  - **Explore docs** (supporting developer self-serve).

**Content depth**

The site should balance **clarity and credibility**:

  - A minimal, fast landing page that convinces developers quickly.

  - Clear pathways into **docs, repo, and checkout.**

  - Enough detail to support enterprise and investor audiences without overwhelming first-time visitors.

**Must-haves from Airweave perspective**

  1. CTA for booking a call.

  1. Checkout flow for self-serve adoption.

  1. Prominent link to OSS GitHub repo.

  1. Clear path into documentation.

# ‚ñ∏ Current Design Assets

[Image: image.png]

[Image: Asset_2_1.svg]

**Current assets**

  - Logo: fixed, but color can be adjusted.

  - No real established color palette beyond the logo.

  - Limited product visuals (no strong screenshots or champion visuals yet).

  - No existing tagline or consistent messaging hierarchy.

**Tone of voice **(to be refined by Airweave)

We want to sound:

  - Developer-first and straightforward.

  - Serious, reliable, and trustworthy.

  - Confident but not flashy.

  - Transparent and clear, avoiding unnecessary hype.

**Messaging hierarchy **(to be refined by Airweave)

  - **One-liner:** clear statement of what Airweave is and does.

  - **Elevator pitch:** 2‚Äì3 sentences with value proposition.

  - **Longer description:** explanation of how it works, why it matters, and what sets it apart.

**Use cases / success stories**

  - No polished case studies yet.

  - Possible to highlight example use cases in future from agent builders once available.

  - For now: focus on showing *how Airweave works* with simple and clear diagrams, code snippets, and example workflows.

**Notes for Tonik**

  - Tonik is expected to help shape the **visual direction** since current design assets are minimal.

  - Airweave is in favor of visually attractive snippets and elements like diagrams, UI snippets and code examples.

  - We can provide input on technical explanations and example use cases during the sprint.

Airweave supports dozens of applications out of the box, including CRMs, support platforms, document stores, cloud drives, BI tools, data warehouses, and more.

See the full list of supported sources *here.* Don't see what you need? Reach out and we'll help.

**How long does implementation take**

Most teams go from install to first answer in minutes.

**What agent frameworks do you support**

Use Airweave with Composio, Pipedream, or your custom framework. Call the SDK or API directly.

**How does Airweave handle privacy**

Your data stays under your control, always. You choose what to sync, who can access it, and you can remove it at any time. Airweave never shares your data outside your organization.

Unblocks agents by letting them find the right answers across apps and formats. Airweave empowers agents with semantic, keyword, hybrid, time-aware, and agentic search with intent, context, and understanding of complex relationships and interdependencies.

**Real-time Data Sync**

Agents always see current information. No stale snapshots. No manual refreshing.

**Prebuilt Connectors**

Pick from a growing catalog of over 20 data sources. Configure once and let Airweave handle auth and sync.

**Framework friendly**

Drop Airweave into LangChain, Composio, Pipedream, or your custom agent stack. Five minutes from install to first answer.

**Open Source Philosophy**

Trust and transparency are our core tenants. Airweave is built in the open and improved by the community.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**What is Airweave?**

Airweave is a data layer for AI agents. It connects to your apps and databases, syncs private data, and gives agents semantic, hybrid, and agentic search with context and intent.

**How is Airweave different from API integration tools**

Traditional tools connect one service to another. Airweave creates a searchable knowledge layer across many services and applications so agents can find the right information without the need for developers to maintain brittle point to point integrations.

**What applications can I connect**

Airweave supports dozens of applications out of the box, including CRMs, support platforms, document stores, cloud drives, BI tools, data warehouses, and more.

See the full list of supported sources *here.* Don't see what you need? Reach out and we'll help.

**How long does implementation take**

Most teams go from install to first answer in minutes.

**What agent frameworks do you support**

Use Airweave with Composio, Pipedream, or your custom framework. Call the SDK or API directly.

**How does Airweave handle privacy**

Your data stays under your control, always. You choose what to sync, who can access it, and you can remove it at any time. Airweave never shares your data outside your organization.
