    Entity Types:
        1. Regular entities: JSON metadata only in entities/
        2. File entities (class name contains "File" + has download_url):
           JSON metadata + actual file in blobs/

        Note: File entities are detected at runtime by:
        - Class name contains "File" (e.g., AsanaFileUnifiedChunk)
        - Has download_url attribute with value

    For file entities, the download_url in the JSON is rewritten to point to the blob:
        "download_url": "s3://{bucket}/{prefix}/collections/{readable_id}/blobs/{entity_id}.pdf"

    Operations:
        - INSERT/UPDATE: Write/overwrite entity JSON (and blob for files)
        - DELETE: Delete entity JSON (and blob for files)

    Event streaming is provided via S3 event notifications (s3:ObjectCreated:*, s3:ObjectRemoved:*).
