    This migration safely handles existing production data by:
    1. Cleaning up any NULL entity_definition_id values (shouldn't exist per CRUD logic)

    3. Creating new (sync_id, entity_id, entity_definition_id) unique constraint

    This allows different entity types (e.g., GoogleCalendarList and GoogleCalendarCalendar)
