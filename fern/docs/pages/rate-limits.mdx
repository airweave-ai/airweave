API requests are rate-limited per organization based on your billing plan. Limits are enforced per minute using a sliding window.

## Limits by Plan

| Plan | Requests per Minute |
|------|---------------------|
| Developer | 10 |
| Pro | 100 |
| Team | 250 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |

## Rate Limit Headers

All API responses include rate limit information:

```
RateLimit-Limit: 100
RateLimit-Remaining: 95
RateLimit-Reset: 1729012345
```

- `RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per minute
- `RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests left in current window
- `RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when limit resets

## Rate Limit Exceeded

When you exceed your limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `Retry-After` header indicating seconds until you can retry.

```json
{
  "detail": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 42 seconds."
}
```
