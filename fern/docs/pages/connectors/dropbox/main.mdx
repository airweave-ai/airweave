## Integrate Airweave with Dropbox APIs on localhost

Airweave will access Dropbox on behalf of your users. You'll need to have each

Dropbox provides [documentation](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide) on how to implement OAuth 2.0.
This guide will walk you through connecting Dropbox APIs to Airweave when running locally.
1. Go [here](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create) to create the "Airweave integration" application
2. Under `Settings`, add the Redirect URI. Use the appropriate URL for your environment:

    **Production (Airweave Cloud):**
        ```
        https://api.airweave.ai/source-connections/callback
        ```

    **Local:**
        ```
        http://localhost:8001/source-connections/callback
        ```

3.Under `Permissions`, select the following scopes:
  ```
  account_info.read
  files.metadata.read
  files.content.read
  profile
  email
  ```
4. Locate the `App key` and `App secret` under `Settings`. Add these credentials to the `dev.integrations.yml` file to enable Dropbox API integration.
