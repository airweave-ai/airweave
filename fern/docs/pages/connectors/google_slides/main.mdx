## Configuration

Google Slides source connector integrates with Google Drive API.

Connects to your Google Drive account to retrieve Google Slides presentations.
Presentations are exported as PDF and processed through Airweave's file
processing pipeline to enable full-text semantic search across presentation content.

Mirrors the Google Drive connector approach - treats Google Slides presentations as
regular files that get processed through the standard file processing pipeline.

The connector handles:
- Presentation listing and filtering via Google Drive API
- Content export and download (PDF format)
- Metadata preservation (ownership, sharing, timestamps)
- Incremental sync via Drive Changes API
